          Jose has been an excellent student since I met him, learning quickly and carrying out all
           his educational tasks in our ITM university, his score is always above 4 which is not easy 
           to achieve and it is thanks to his continuous effort.
          <span>&#8221;</span>
        </div>
        <div class="recommendation">
          <span>&#8220;</span>
          During his stay in our company Sodexo he achieved things that his colleagues saw impossible 
          at first instance but from the beginning he gave me the confidence that he could do it, advancing 
          from biomedical field technologist to be national coordinator of biomedical and industrial equipment 
          of our company Suramericana through Sodexo S.A. I believe that to achieve this in less than 3 years 
          speaks for itself, he is an excellent employee.
          <span>&#8221;</span>

          <span>&#8220;</span>
          I have known Jose for more than 10 years, I have worked with him and I am his friend, I am inspired 
          by every step he takes and how he performs with resilience at the educational and work level giving 
          changes to his environment in a positive way. He is also very responsible, aligns to processes quickly 
          and has a service attitude that is very appealing to upper management and clients. On the other hand, 
          he is an unconditional friend, sociable and humorous when the moment requires it, he will surely go far 
          no matter where he is. !
